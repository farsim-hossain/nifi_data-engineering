# Data Engineering Using NIFI, Hive, Spark, Kafka and Quicksight
project to create a data pipeline where we will use Apache NIFI to ingest and distribute data into different platforms. Kafka comes into the picture to send and receive messages to trigger Spark for data processing. We will finally store the data in HDFS and analyze the data using Hive and visualize them with Quicksight.
